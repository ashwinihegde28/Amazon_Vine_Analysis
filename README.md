# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Big Data using PySpark, Amazon Web Service (AWS), Google Colaboratory, and pgAdmin.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program, a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews of their products and determine if there are any biases between Vine members and Non-Vine member's reviews.

Companies that will pay a fee to Amazon and may provide free products to Vine members who are then required to publish a review. In order to determine if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members vs. non-members, we need to identify the percentage of 5 star ratings to total rating. As part of this exercise, we were asked to choose from 50 datasets to extract, transform and load into a dataframe in order to complete our analysis. Throughout this analysis, we used Using PySpark to perform ETL, the analysis extracts the dataset, transforms the data, connects to an AWS RDS instance, loads the transformed data into pgAdmin.

## Steps Involved
- Define big data and describe the challenges associated with it.
- Define Hadoop and name the main elements of its ecosystem.
- Explain how MapReduce processes data.
- Define Spark and explain how it processes data.
- Describe how NLP collects and analyzes text data.
- Explain how to use AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) and relational databases for basic cloud storage.
- Complete an analysis of an Amazon customer review.
